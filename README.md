# fizz-buzz

This challenge is meant to help developers solve the FizzBuzz challenge in nodejs programming language following TDD.

## Problem
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

## Tips
Try to separate each requirement into its own test case and try to make that test pass. Step by step, you will implement the solution as a whole.
